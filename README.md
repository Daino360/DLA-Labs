- **Platform:** Google Colab (NVIDIA T4 GPU)
- **Description:** Implementation of standard deep learning models such as Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, and ResNet.
- **Goal:** Compare model performance on a typical image classification task.

### LAB 2 - Deep Reinforcement Learning Laboratory
- **Platform:** Local Jupyter Notebook (NVIDIA GeForce 940MX) on VS Code
- **Description:** Exploration of Deep Reinforcement Learning using OpenAI Gym environments.
- **Algorithms:** DQN, A2C, etc.

### LAB 3 - Working with Transformers in the Hugging Face Ecosystem
- **Platform:** Local Jupyter Notebook (NVIDIA GeForce 940MX) on VS Code
- **Description:** Utilizing Hugging Face `transformers` for NLP tasks such as text classification and question answering.
- **Tools:** `transformers`, `datasets`, `tokenizers`

## Reproducibility Instructions

Each lab is self-contained and can be run directly in Jupyter Notebook using the instructions below. For LAB2 and LAB3, is it necessary to use **conda environments** to ensure proper dependency isolation and GPU compatibility.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DLA-Labs.git
cd DLA-Labs
```
### Step 2: Create and Activate Conda Environments
LAB 2 — Deep Reinforcement Learning

Create the environment and activate it:
```
conda create -n DRL -c conda-forge gymnasium pytorch-gpu matplotlib pygame jupyterlab
conda activate DRL
```
Launch Jupyter:
```
jupyter lab
```
Open LAB2/Lab2-DRL.ipynb to run the experiments.
Pre-trained models (*.pth) are already included in the folder for reproducibility.
LAB 3 — Transformers with Hugging Face

Create and activate the environment:
```
conda create -n transformers -c conda-forge transformers datasets matplotlib scikit-learn torchvision pytorch-gpu accelerate sentencepiece jupyterlab ipywidgets tqdm
conda activate transformers
```
Launch Jupyter:
```
jupyter lab
```
Open LAB3/Lab3-transformers.ipynb to run the notebook.
All results are reproducible using the uploaded code and models.

    📝 Note for LAB 1:
    LAB1 was executed in Google Colab using a free NVIDIA T4 GPU. You can run Lab1-CNN.ipynb directly in Colab. No setup is required beyond installing packages within the notebook.
